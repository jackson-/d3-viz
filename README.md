# d3-viz

These are some D3.js projects I've worked on

BASIC:

These were projects from me learning the foundation of D3.js. They include a line chart,
pie chart, fancier pie chart, and a bar chart.

DASHBOARD TEMPLATE:

This a fully responsive data viz dashboard template. It uses MongoDB to store documents, DC.js to assist in creating the charts, Bootstrap for responsiveness, and Keen.io for the html template. The files to be stored in MongoDB can be downloaded for importing here:
